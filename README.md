# openvpn-client-rio-base
Even more all-in-one OpenVPN docker, now also comes with *arr apps.

Note: At some point late 2022, mono cannot be installed in docker ubuntu arm32 due to a circular dependency error. Hence I will not be building arm32 (aka armhf / armv7) for a while.

This is the base image with all apps pre-installed installed. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own customization.
* Ubuntu base
* OpenVPN client
* Stubby (DNS over TLS)
* Dante Server (Socks proxy)
* Tiny Proxy (HTTP proxy)
* Flood UI with Transmission daemon
* Jackett
